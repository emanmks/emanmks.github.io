                        I am Solaiman Mansyur: a father of three. I am raising a kids whose in their golden ages.
                        During Covid-19 pandemic, I become home-schooling teacher for them.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-base my-4">
                        I started my (first 5 year) career as a lone IT staff in the company, building a desktop application for a company
                        with more than 15 branches in the area. No mentorship, no technical feedback, a lot of bad decisions,
                        one of them is accepting the offer for a manager position.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-base my-4">
                        In 2012, I built my final project in the university using web based application. Since then, I always choose web based solution
                        for the projects that I am handling.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-base my-4">
                        In late 2015, I moved to Malaysia, where I finally introduced to a high quality and high standard software development.
                        I got mentorship, technical feedback, professional feedback that helped me to grow a lot as a professional web developer.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-base my-4">
                        In the last 5 years, I have been exposed to industry standard for CI and CD using agile approaches. Implement clean architecture
                        and clean code base, infrastructure as a code, test-driven development and other good practices in the industry.
                    </p>
